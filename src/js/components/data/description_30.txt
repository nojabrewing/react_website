In 2021, I really had an urge to brew Saisons again because the last I brewed was in 2019 and I missed the drinkability and
simple elegance of that style. The first one would be a table Saison as a low ABV thirst quencher for spring and summer.
And since I like the Polish Piwo Grodziskie style a lot, the malt bill would be 100 percent oak-smoked wheat malt.
I used Hallertau Blanc, my go-to hops for Saisons that provides spicy but also very elegant gooseberry and white wine
notes. Fermentation would be done with the reliable French Saison yeast.</br>
For mashing I needed to add ten percent rice hulls, and I used a traditional Piwo Grodziskie four-step mash schedule.
The hops were added in the usual first-wort and whirlpool combination for 30 IBU. I planned to have 1.032 original gravity
but only got 1.028, probably due to the wheat-only malt bill. This was okay because the yeast would take it down to 1.000,
and that would make it a good 4% table strength beer.</br>
Fermentation was as boring and predictable as ever at 24Â°C for three weeks, leaving basically no residual sugar. At the
end of fermentation, I added 5 g/l of Hallertau Blanc for three days of dry-hopping. This was the first time I added the hops
completely loose in the fermentor to get a better extraction. During racking, I used a stainless filter tube attached to my
auto-siphon to keep most of the hops and yeast behind.</br>
The beer was drinkable after one week of bottle fermentation, and it had a pleasantly smoked, spicey, and fruity aroma.
The difference in aroma to a beech-smoked beer is quite hard to describe. It has no ham but a very nuanced and more subtle
character that blends much easier with other phenolics and hop aromas. The Saison character was less pronounced but still
there, and also the Hallertau Blanc hops worked perfectly. It will be interesting to see how the beer develops over time.
