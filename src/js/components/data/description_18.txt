A bit too late for the heat wave of 2018, I decided to brew a table Saison in July.
The idea was to have a light and refreshing thirst quencher with the addition of raspberries
and cardamom to make things a little more interesting.</br>
The grist consisted of 50% Pilsner malt, 20% Golden Promise, 15% wheat malt, 10% flaked oats,
and 5% Munich malt. This combination provides a crisp and grainy foundation, a bit of biscuit,
some protein enhanced body and mouthfeel as well as a slight bready undertone. A moderate
bitterness was provided by a very small FWH and larger whirlpool addition of Hallertau Blanc hops.
It should only support the spiciness of the yeast and cardamom without getting in the way of the
raspberries. Raspberries work quite well in Saisons as they add a slight acidity and some fruitiness
that balances the usual dry spiciness.</br>
I used a step mash of 63°C and 68°C to get lots of fermentable sugars. The French
Saison yeast I used again usually does not care and eats almost anything. After boiling for an hour,
I ended up with a Berliner Weisse-strength wort of 1.031 OG. Plenty for a table Saison.
To let the Cardamom provide its unique aromas I decided to ferment cooler than usual at 21°C to reduce
the ester and phenols produced by the yeast. Primary fermentation was finished after ten days. I then
added 50g/l of frozen raspberries to the beer and let it sit for another 14 days, before bottling it.</br>
The finished beer had a pink-orange color with lots of raspberry and only hints of cardamom in the aroma.
It had a quite light body, a sparkling carbonation, and a well-rounded mouthfeel. The taste was mainly
raspberry and spices accompanied by a refreshing dryness. All in all a good summer thirst quencher that
hopefully tastes even better in 2019 spring and summer.
