This was my first ever homebrew. Planned as a hoppy american amber ale, it turned out
more ruby than amber. It was brewed with light and amber liquid malt extract and
four different hops: Polaris, Nugget, Willamette, and Saphir; targeting 70 IBU which was a
bit too much. I additionally dry-hopped it with Polaris and Willamette.
Starting out with dry yeast, I used Nottingham ale yeast for a fruity fermentation.<br/>
The taste turned out to be quite malty with a fruity hop character at the beginning and
a long lasting bitter finish. There was no minty hop character from Polaris at all, but
this could have been caused by using too many hop varieties.
