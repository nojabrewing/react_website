Making an IPA in 2017 without at least one of the cheater hops (Citra, Mosaic) was almost impossible.
So I decided to use Mosaic, the sluttiest hop around (according to the
<a class="bold" href="http://www.stealthisbeer.com" target="_blank">Steal This Beer</a> podcast).
It provides a wide range of aromas including tropical fruits and berries,
complemented by an earthy dankness which makes it ideal for a single-hop IPA.
The malt bill consisted of equals parts of Golden Promise and Maris Otter malts, accompanied
by 10% wheat malt, 10% oats, and 5% dark munich malt. The idea was to create a 7% ABV IPA with
55 IBU, a creamy, silky mouthfeel, medium body, and a contemporary hop aroma.
I chose US-05 for a neutral yeast character that does not get in the way of the hops.<br/>
I mashed at 66°C to get a balanced wort that had an FG of 1.065 after a 60-minute boil.
Most of the 55 IBU came from a 15% FWH addition after the second runnings that preserved a lot
of the hop flavor. While the boil was running, I remembered how great FWH was for avoiding boil-overs.
After the boil was finished, I removed the kettle from the heat and let it cool for ten minutes
before adding the whirlpool hops for another 30 minutes. When the wort was cooled down, I added the
rehydrated yeast and set up my new "fermentation chamber".<br/>
As I don't have enough space for a fermentation fridge, I bought a <a class="bold"
href="http://www.cool-brewing.com" target="_blank">Cool Brewing Bag</a> to better
control the fermentation temperature. The idea here is to put the fermentor in a huge, isolated bag
with some ice bottles that have to be exchanged after 12 to 24 hours to keep a constant fermentation
temperature. I also bought a cheap cable thermometer and attached it to the fermentor to check the
temperature without opening the bag. With two 1.5l bottles I was able to keep a stable 16°C
ambient temperature. Due to the lower temperature, fermentation was a bit slower than usual and finished
after ten days at 1.012. I then added a 5g/l dry-hopping addition for four days, before bottling and
conditioning for two weeks.<br/>
The finished beer had an amber-orange color with a medium white head. The aroma was ripe tropical fruits
like mango and papaya, but it also had a very catty, earthy dankness that resembled Simcoe a lot.
The mouthfeel was slightly creamy, but not as much as I expected from 20% protein-rich adjuncts.
Taste was fruity with biscuity malts in the background that provided quite some toastiness. A 70/30 ratio
between Golden Promise and Maris Otter would have probably been better for an IPA. The finish had a
well-rounded bitterness that provided a great balance to the biscuity malts. The beer had a great drinkability
at 7.2% ABV and went into an East-Coast IPA direction without being the hazy/ juicy type. Mosaic works
great in a single-hop IPA but it also benefits a lot from a less earthy companion like Citra or Amarillo.
