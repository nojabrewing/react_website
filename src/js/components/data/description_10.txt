My first try at a Belgian Saison was originally planned as an English session IPA with only
English Mild Ale malt and East Kent Golding hops. However, since the temperatures were much
too high in June to ferment with an English ale yeast, I switched to Mangrove Jack's M29 French
Saison yeast to make it a single-malt-and-single-hop Saison.
The original gravity was 1.037 which would have probably ended up at roughly 3.5% ABV with an
English yeast. However, this Saison yeast was a monster attenuater that left the beer at 1.003
final gravity which corresponds to 4.6% ABV. I started fermenting at 20°C and let the temperature
climb to 25°C over a couple of days. After that I let the temperature rise freely. The beer
was fully attenuated after 10 days.<br/>
The finished beer was nicely dry with phenolic aromas of cloves and pepper accompanied by a hint
of peaches. This was well supported by the earthiness of the hops which has also been used for
dry-hopping. However, this was hardly noticable. For me, Saisons are now the go-to beers to brew
during the summer months as they can tolerate higher temperatures and deliver a very drinkable
and refreshing summer beer.
