Since 2015, there is the <a class="bold" target="_blank" href="http://www.berlinbeerweek.com">Berlin
Beer Week</a>, an annual week in Berlin dedicated to craft beer events. Part of this week
is a homebrewing competition based on the wort of the week's official beer brewed by the <a class="bold"
target="_blank" href="http://www.brewbaker.de">BrewBaker</a> brewery in Berlin-Moabit. Each interested
homebrewer could create his or her own turn on the base beer to be served at the closing event of the week.
The beers were then to be judged by the audience with the winner getting the chance to brew the beer in a
larger volume.<br/>
In 2016, the base beer was an amplified 1.048 OG Berliner Weisse wort, Citra mash-hopped and refined with
some honey and lemon zest during the boil.
My idea was to create a lightly sour beer that was not based on lactobacillus souring. Unfortunately, the wort
got an infection from the brewery and started fermenting while I was waiting for some cooler weather to start
the fermentation. I decided to re-boil the wort and topped off with water to keep the volume. I also added
some East Kent Golding hops in the last minutes to get some more aroma. For the fermentation, I used
WLP002 English ale yeast for the first couple of days to get a nice fruityness and afterwards, I used US-05
to bring the gravity down. The sourness was created by racking the 10 liters of finished beer on to 1.5 kg
of freshly cut and frozen rhubarb, and letting it sit for two weeks.<br/>
Due to the re-boil, the already present alcohol was evaporated and the finished beer ended up at 3.5% ABV. It
was nicely dry and fruity with quite some rhubarb aroma having a slight sourness supported by
a pretty good carbonation.
