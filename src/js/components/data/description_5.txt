Pumpkin meets beet root for the ultimate autumn ale vegetable clash, featuring pumpkin pie spices like
cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger, and cardamom. To support the earthy flavor of beet root,
I used German Magnum and Northern Brewer hops for bittering and flavor with a target of 45 IBU. For aroma, I used freshly picked
wild hops from the Uckermark (the place where I grew up) as a whirlpool addition. The malt base consists of pale ale and vienna
malt, and some light and medium crystal malt for body and color. I also added a bit of Carafa Special II malt
to get a deep reddish color, but instead it got brown. However, when I poured the fermented beer on to the
beet root in the secondary, it got bloody dark red. The beer finished at around 5% ABV.<br/>
The first thing to notice about the beer is a really nice pink head.
The scent of the beer contains lots of cinnamon, ginger, and clove mixed
with earthiness of beet root. The beginning is slightly sweet which turns into
a spice dominated finish. Hop bitterness is present but has only a supportive role.<br/>
I wouldn't call this a drinkable everyday beer, but as an autumn/ winter seasonal it works for me.
I should probably do a split badge w/o beet root if I brew it again, and leave the Carafa malt out.
