This was my second attempt at a table beer. This time with Golden Promise, rye, and wheat malt, as well as flaked oats in the grist.
The majority of hops were homegrown in my parents' garden and consisted of Hallertauer Blanc, Mandarina Bavaria, and some Centennial.
I decided to you use London Ale III yeast to get a low attenuation, good mouthfeel, and also some bio transformation.</br>

Mashing was done for an hour at 73째C and resulted in an original gravity of 1.035. I used some Hallertauer Blanc pellets as a
first-wort addition and a bigger dose during whirlpool and hop stand to achieve a bitterness of roughly 30 IBU. Fermentation
was done at 18째C for the first three days, and then ramped up to 21째C over the next ten days. I then dry-hopped with 10 g/l of the
homegrown Hallertauer Blanc, Mandarina, and Centennial whole cone hops. After dry-hopping was finished, the specific gravity was at 1.015,
hence only 57% apparent attenuation.</br>

I first tried the beer ten days after bottling, and while having a good mouthfeel and body, it was lacking hop aroma. The reason for that
might be that I didn't break up the whole cone hops enough before putting them into the beer for dry-hopping. When the beer was removed
from the hop cones, they were still intact and smelled great. The beer probably didn't get in contact with the lupulin glands which were protected
by the leaves.</br>

Over time, the bottles over-carbonated pretty consistently, and the final gravity went down to 1.006, more than two degrees plato since bottling.
I guess there was a lot of hop creep going on as the homegrown hops were air dried at 25째C and left a lot of enzymes intact. The additional
fermentation and carbonation scrubbed a lot of the aroma and taste, and left the beer in a drinkable but not really enjoyable state.
