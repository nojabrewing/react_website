January 2021 seemed like a good time to brew another Lager after successfully brewing a Kellerbier the year before.
This time it would be a non-Reinheitsgebot New England style Lager with a malt bill that contained wheat, oat, chit,
and Pilsner malt. For the hops I chose Hallertau Mittelfr&uuml;h and Saphir, two classic German noble hops which would
be used for bittering, whirpool, and dry-hopping.</br>

The mash schedule was a very simple 65°C single infusion that created a protein rich wort of 1.049 gravity. As with my previous
Lager, I used the reliable W-34/70 yeast again. At the beginning of the fermentation, my natural cold chamber had a temperature
of 11°C which was great. However, at the end of January the weather became quite cold in comparison to recent years with temperatures
below -10°C for several weeks. The temperature in the fermentation chamber went below 9°C and the yeast completely stopped fermenting.</br>

I wrapped the fermentor in blankets and waited for a couple of days but it didn't help, and so I moved it to a warmer place because W-34/70
is known to work pretty well with warmer temperatures. I let the temperature rise to 15°C, the lowest I could achieve with my frozen
bottle cooler. After two more weeks and a short diacetyl rest, I moved the fermentor back to the cold chamber and left it there for
another 4 weeks. Then I added 10 g/l of Mittelfr&uuml;h and Saphir for four days of dry-hopping.</br>

After two weeks of bottle fermentation I had a first try and it was very unbalanced. There was a strong yeast character with a bit of
oxidation, the floral and spicy noble hop character that I was looking for was hardly noticeable. Over time, the balance got better
and the beer become more drinkable, but unfortunately it never was what I had hoped for. Maybe the bumpy fermentation was to blame but
it could also be unhealthy yeast or hops that was maybe not fresh anymore.
