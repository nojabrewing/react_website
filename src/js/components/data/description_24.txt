More than four years after brewing my first Lager, a California Common, in 2015, it was time to brew my first ever Pilsner.
Living in a German Altbau appartment, we have a storage room a staircase below our appartment that was used for the toilet
at the beginning of the 20th century. During winter, this storage room has a very stable temperature of 10 to 11°C. Perfect
for brewing Lager.</br>

The recipe for this Pilsner should be as simple and traditional as possible. So, I decided for 100% Barke Pilsner malt,
Hallertau Mittelfr&uuml;h as the only hop, and W-34/70, the most common Lager yeast in the world. It should have around 5%
ABV and 35 IBU. And as it should not be filtered, it was going to be a Kellerpils. Since the storage room is basically the
cellar, I chose the German name "Halbe Treppe".</br>

Although it's possible to do a decoction with the Grainfather, I didn't want to mess around too much and used a step mash
with 62°C and 70°C. To get enough bitterness with a 4% alpha hops, I started with a first-wort addition, followed by a
30-minute addition, and finally a pretty big whirlpool addition. For fermentation, I tried something similar to the quick
lagering method proposed by Br&uuml;losophy: a two-week primary followed by a short diacetyl rest, and then another two weeks
of lagering before bottling and conditioning.</br>

After roughly six weeks, I tried the beer for the first time and it had a wonderfully floral, spicy, and woody aroma with
hints of liquorice and apricot. The body was medium with an effervescent mouthfeel and nice crispness. Taste was a rustic
graininess with notes of honey in the background and some Lager yeast character that reminded me of Franconian Kellerbiers.
The bitterness was subtle but still profound enough to provide a nice balance in the finish.</br>

Sometimes, simplicity is really the key to making good beer and I now understand why Pilsner is often called brewer's beer.
