When my daughter Ella was born, I decided to make single-hop beer with Australian Ella hops for her
first birthday. I wanted to create a beer that is drinkable and not too heavy on the alcohol with a
lot of tropical Southern Hemisphere aroma. Ella is a half-sister of Galaxy with its very own
characteristics that originate from German Spalt hops.<br/>
The beer was going to be an American Pale Ale with around 5% ABV and 40 IBU. I used a similar malt
bill as for the Mosaic IPA but with only 20% Maris Otter and 60% Golden Promise to have a bit more
grain sweetness than toastiness. One third of the bitterness was provided by a small FWH addition.
The rest was created during a 30-minute hopstand after whirlpooling for a few minutes. Due to some
impatience, I missed the target mash temperature of 66°C and mashed at only 64°C. The original
gravity was 1.051 with plenty of fermentable sugers. I chose US-05 again for fermentation as it is
really easy to use and it doesn't get in the way of the hops. Fermentation finished at 1.010 with
5.4% ABV which was quite close to what I wanted. I then dry-hopped with 5 g/l for 3 days before
priming and bottling for 2.5 volumes of CO2.<br/>
The finished beer had a golden hue with a medium white had. The aroma was tropical with lots of
passionfruit and hints of peach and mango, accompanied by some spicy-herbal grassiness and something
anise-like. The mouthfeel was again very pleasant thanks to the wheat malt and flaked oats. Golden Promise
in combination with some Maris Otter and a bit of Munich provided a great bready malt backbone with
hints of toast and cookies. This was complimented by a noticable but nicely balanced bitterness in the finish.
