Although the name maybe suggests an Old Ale, brew #6 is an American barleywine hopped only
with Simcoe&reg; hops. I wanted to see if I can manage to brew a barleywine with my system and
my brewing techniques. Since I read that the mash efficiency is relatively low for big beers,
I used 9.5 kilograms of malt for 15 liters with a target of roughly 10% ABV and 100 IBU. The malt bill
consisted of 94% pale ale malt, 3% CaraAmber, and 3% CaraMunich II.
For fermentation I used most of the WLP001 yeast cake from brew #5. The beer went from 1.105
to 1.020 which leads to roughly 11% ABV. Hence, mission accomplished.<br/>
After the primary fermentation was over, the beer went into secondary for one month of conditioning.
I had a first try after additional 3 months of bottle conditioning. At first it was pretty
overwhelming because 11% ABV in a beer is a lot. Due to the high attenuation the
beer is not really sweet and that is good. So far, it has a very nice malty taste with the hops struggling
a bit to hold up against the alcohol. I will let it mellow out for another 3 or 6 months
and try it again.
