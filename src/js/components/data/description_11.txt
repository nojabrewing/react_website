After my beet root dominated autumn beer in 2015, I wanted to make something that is more pumpkin.
I completely passed on adding spices and used the Mangrove Jack's M29 French Saison yeast instead
to make a pumpkin saison. The malt bill consisted of Pilsner, Golden Promise, Munich, and 20% rye malt.
And since it should be a pumpkin beer, I also added a lot of butternut squash (30%) to the mash.
I expected some gravity bump from the pumpkin, but butternut contains
hardly any sugar, so I ended up with an OG of 1.053. I used Columbus hops in the boil as a 20-minute
addition which added roughly 30 IBU. The beer fermented at 25Â°C and ended up at 1.005 FG corresponding
to 6.3% ABV which is a pretty good value for a Saison.<br/>
The finished beer is nicely dry and has some cloves and pepper spiciness accompanied by a bit of
peach aroma from the yeast. The malt and hop balance worked out quite well with the rye providing
a nice edge. There is also a nice, subdued citrussy hoppiness from Columbus which is a very underestimated
hops in my opinion. Unfortunately, the pumpkin is hardly noticeable. Probably because butternut is not very
dominant in taste and more of a pie pumpkin. Hokkaido would have added more pumpkin flavor and aroma,
maybe. Nonetheless I'm really happy with the overall result.
