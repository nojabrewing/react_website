For my first real wheat beer I decided to make a sessionable American wheat ale that was "Gr&auml;tzed" up by some
oak-smoked wheat malt typical of the classic Polish Gr√§tzer or Grodziskie style of beer. The malt bill
consisted of 20% Pilsener, 20% Pale Ale, 10% Munich, and 50% wheat malt of which 20% were oak-smoked.
For the hops I used German Magnum for a clean bitterness and the often used Amarillo&reg;-Simcoe&reg;
combination as a whirlpool addition
for some nice fruity-piney aroma. I used US-05 yeast to get a clean fermentation character.<br/>
The finished beer had an FG of 1.010 with 4% ABV and was exactly what I wanted for a summer wheat ale.
I aimed for 25 IBU but this was exceeded quite a bit by the whirlpool addition due to the relatively high alpha acid
content of Amarillo&reg; and Simcoe&reg;. The oak-smoked wheat malt added an interesting twist which provided the
beer with some unconventional spicyness as a nice counterpart to the fruityness of the hops. The high percentage
of wheat provided a nice creamy mouthfeel and some breadyness.
