A Cascadian Dark Ale made with rye for a slight spicyness and Hull Melon for a
melon-like hop aroma. That was the premise for brew #4. For the malt base I used
85% pale ale malt and 8% rye malt accompanied by 3% of CaraMunich II and 4% dehusked
Carafa II malt for a rich body and a nice dark color without being overly roasty. I hopped
with German Magnum, Cascade, and Hull Melon for a citrussy and honeydew melon aroma
with a target of 65 IBU. For fermentation I used WLP001.<br/>
I aimed for an OG of 1.070 but unfortunately the malt was not properly crushed, so
I ended up with 1.050 OG. The final beer had 1.012 which leads to around Alc. 4.9% Vol. Hence,
it was more a session version of a Cascadian Dark Ale. The beer has a nice dark, almost
opaque color with ruby accents. The body is quite balanced with a nice mouthfeel and
a fruity aroma with hints of roastiness. Unfortunately there is no melon aroma at all.
It's more a mixture of citrus and strawberry which the Hull Melon is also known for. The
finish is heavily hoppy but not overwhelming.
