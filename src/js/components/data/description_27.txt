For my next autumn beer I was in the mood for something rustic and bitter with some old school West Coast vibes.
I've never had the opportunity to try Sierra Nevada's Ruthless Rye IPA, but it should be something similar.
So I chose Chico ale yeast, Simcoe and British Jester hops which should provide lots of citrus, pine, and dank notes.
The malt base was Maris Otter, and rye malt, with the addition of melanoidin, crystal rye, and chocolate wheat
malt to provide a layered maltiness with toasted rye bread and a slight roastiness.</br>

I used a very simple 66°C single infusion mash, a small Columbus first-wort and a bigger Simcoe and Jester whirlpool addition
to reach 60 IBU. The beer fermented at 18°C for a week, and then I raised the temperature slowly to 21°C over a couple of days.
Then I added 10 g/l of Simcoe and Jester for three days of dry-hopping before priming and bottling.</br>

The finished beer looked like a very muddy mahagony colored brown ale for the first couple of months. It also tasted very
unbalanced and yeasty, and not in good way. After trying a few bottles over the first weeks, I decided to wait a bit longer.
Coming back roughly six months later, the beer had a clear ruby red color. The aroma and taste were much better than before.
Still a bit yeasty but the malts and hops had mellowed into a nicely piney, earthy, and malty old school IPA.
