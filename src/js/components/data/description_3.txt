Brew #1 was all extract. Brew #2 was extract with grains. So, brew #3 had to be all-grain
to follow the scheme. After brewing two ales, I also wanted to make a lager. California
Common was the obvious choice as I can ferment it at nearly room temperature. Following this
simple beer style, I used 90% pale ale malt and 10% medium caramel malt. The hopping was done
using only German Northern Brewer with a target of 35 IBU. For fermentation I made a starter from
a pack of Wyeast 2112.<br/>
Brew #3 turned out to be a reddish copper colored, malty, and moderately hopped lager with
a slightly fruity aroma. Building up carbonation took a lot of time, but after around two
months, the mouthfeel was great.
