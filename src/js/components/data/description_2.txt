My first brew in 2016 was an Extra Strong Bitter with a traditional English ale yeast (WLP002).
I wanted to have a nice malty ale, so I chose Maris Otter as the base malt for lots of biscuity flavor
supported by some medium crystal, a bit of very dark crystal, and a tiny bit of black malt.
For hopping I used only East Kent Goldings to get a typical English bittering character. To get as
much hop flavor as possible without being too bitter, I used a combination of first wort hopping and
whirlpooling with a target of 40 IBU.<br/>
The fermentation was quite vigorous for the first couple of days and brought the OG of 1.059 to an FG
of 1.012 after two weeks in the primary, which ended up in 6% ABV and was exactly what I wanted.
However, bottling with the ESB yeast can be a nightmare. In some cases, the yeast woke up during bottling
and started fermenting again which led to some overcarbonated bottles. This is probably due to the super
high flocculation characteristics of this yeast. For the next beer with the ESB yeast, I have to rouse it
regularly and maybe even use a second, less flocculating yeast in the secondary fermentation to clean up
properly before bottling.<br/>
The beer has a great malty and also quite fruity flavor with some earthiness and a little bit of honey from
the hops. The bitterness is very smooth and feels more like 30 than 40 IBU. The first wort hopping really
worked for me in this beer.
