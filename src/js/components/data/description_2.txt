As an IPA seemed too intimidating for my second try, I went for an American Pale Ale with
a triple hop combination of Columbus, Amarillo&reg;, and Ahtanum&trade; with a target of 60 IBU.
For the malt base I used extra light dry malt extract and light liquid malt extract. To enhance the
taste and to advance my brewing process, I used Maris Otter pale ale as a steeping addition.
For fermentation I used Mangrove Jack's London Ale dry yeast.<br/>
The beer turned out deep golden with a citrussy and floral aroma. The malt character was more
subtle than for brew #1, creating a slighter body. The carbonation was a bit
strong without being a Hefeweizen or Belgian Wit. The finish was hoppy and bitter but not as
long lasting as for brew #1.
