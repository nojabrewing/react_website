            <h3>Why I began homebrewing</h3>
            <p>
              When I visited New York in 2014, I learned that beer can be more than Pilsener,
              Export, and Hefeweizen. After I tried american pale ales and vienna lagers loaded with American hops, I was
              instantly hooked by the rich taste in comparison to boring, bland tasting German macro beer.
              Back in Germany, I did a bit of investigation and discovered a whole world of beer styles like brown ales,
              porters, IPAs, imperial stouts, or barleywines. And the best thing is that you can actually
              make these at home, and there are tons of information available about homebrewing.<br/>
              Although there are German books about brewing, I started
              reading <a class="bold" target="_blank" href="http://howtobrew.com/intro.html">How to Brew</a> because
              Germans tend to overcomplicate things especially when explaining something technical like brewing that has
              such a long tradition in Germany. Since I don't like prebuilt things
              that I can't modify, I didn't go for the usual pre-hopped beer kit. Instead, I bought some malt
              extracts and hops and tried to make a beer which is a bit more of my own.<br/>
              After I made my first two badges based on malt extract, I wanted to do something more interesting
              and so I went for all-grain. Since a Braumeister was too expensive, I build a mash-lauter-tun from
              a camping cooler with a copper manifold. For making a yeast starter, I build a stir-plate
              from a wooden box, a PC-case fan, and a magnet from an old hard drive. There is a lot to learn
              from American homebrewers when it comes to equipment. At first, my brewing efficiency was about
              60%. After adjusting the mash ph and using batch sparging with equal runnings, it is now at 70%.
