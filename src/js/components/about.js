            <h2>Why I began homebrewing</h2>
            <p>
              The idea of starting to brew at home came after visiting New York in 2014. Until then, I was the typical
              mass market Lager drinker. When I first tried Brooklyn Lager by accident, I was
              instantly hooked by the rich taste in comparison to boring, bland tasting German macro beer. At the Brooklyn
              Brewery, I also saw a home brew kit that somehow planted the idea of homebrewing in my head.
              Back in Germany, I did a bit of investigation and discovered a whole world of beer styles like IPAs, Porters,
              Imperial Stouts, or Saisons. And the best thing is that you can actually make these at home.<br/>
              Although there are German books about brewing, I started
              reading <a className="bold" target="_blank" href="http://howtobrew.com/intro.html">How to Brew</a> because
              Germans tend to overcomplicate things especially when explaining something technical like brewing that has
              such a long tradition in Germany. I started out with a 20 liter brew pot, an induction cooker, and a Speidel
              fermentor which are still in use until today. After I made my first two badges based on malt extract, I wanted more
              and switched to all-grain. For the next five years I used a converted camping cooler for mostly single-infusion mashing
              and lautering.<br/>
              When my shiny 3500W induction cooker broke in 2019, I decided to buy a Grainfather. Besides all the conveniences it brings,
              the things I like most about it are the counter-flow chiller and the time I safe on brew day. Brewing with
              it still feels like work and has a lot of manual steps that can go wrong if you are not paying attention &ndash; like I did when
              I was using it the first time.<br/>
              Nowadays, I brew four times a year with the seasons, i.e. IPAs and Pale Ales in sprint and autumn, Saisons or Kveik ales in
              summer, and sometimes even a Lager in winter.
